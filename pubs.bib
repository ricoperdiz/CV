  abstract  = {Woody plant diversity from the Amazonian savannas has been poorly quantified. In order to improve the knowledge on wood plants of these regional ecosystems, a tree inventory was carried out in four different habitats used by indigenous people living in the savanna areas of the Northern Brazilian Amazon. The habitats were divided into two types (or groups) of vegetation formations: forest (riparian forest, forest island, and buritizal = Mauritia palm formation) and non-forest (typical savanna). The inventory was carried out in two hectares established in the Darora Indigenous Community region, north of the state of Roraima.
The typical savanna is the most densely populated area (709 stems ha-1); however, it has the lowest tree species richness (nine species, seven families) in relation to typical forest habitats: riparian forest (22 species, 13 families and 202 stems ha-1), forest islands (13 species, 10 families and 264 stems ha-1), and buritizal (19 species, 15 families and 600 stems ha-1). The tree structure (density and dominance) of the forest habitats located in the savanna areas studied in this work is smaller in relation to forest habitats derived from continuous areas of other parts of the Amazon. These environments are derived from Paleoclimatic fragmentation, and are currently affected by the impact of intensive use of natural resources as timberselective logging and some land conversion for agriculture.},

  abstract  = {Estimates of carbon-stock changes in forest ecosystems require information on dead wood decomposition rates. In the Amazon, the lack of data is dramatic due to the small number of studies and the large range of forest types. The aim of this study was to estimate the decomposition rate of coarse woody debris (CWD) in two oligotrophic undisturbed forest formations of the northern Brazilian Amazon: seasonally flooded and unflooded. We analyzed 20 arboreal individuals (11 tree species and 3 palm species) with distinct wood-density categories. The mean annual decomposition rate of all samples independent of forest formation ranged from 0.044 to 0.963 yr−1, considering two observation periods (12 and 24 months). The highest rate (0.732 ± 0.206 [SD] yr−1) was observed for the lowest wood-density class of palms, whereas the lowest rate (0.119 ± 0.101 yr−1) was determined for trees with high wood density. In terms of forest formation, the rates values differ when weighted by the wood-density classes, indicating that unflooded forest (0.181 ± 0.083 [SE] yr−1; mean decay time 11–30 years) has a decomposition rate ∼19% higher than the seasonally flooded formations (0.152 ± 0.072 yr−1; 13–37 years). This result reflects the dominance of species with high wood density in seasonally flooded formations. In both formations 95% of the dead wood is expected to disappear within 30–40 years. Based on our results, we conclude that the CWD decomposition in the studied area is slower in forests on nutrient-poor seasonally flooded soils, where structure and species composition result in ∼40% of the aboveground biomass being in tree species with high wood density. Thus, it is estimated that CWD in seasonally flooded forest formations has longer residence time and slower carbon release by decomposition (respiration) than in unflooded forests. These results improve our ability to model stocks and fluxes of carbon derived from decomposition of dead wood in undisturbed oligotrophic forests in the Rio Negro-Rio Branco Basin, northern Brazilian Amazon.},

Populations of P. oligolepis were found in two previously unknown areas, occurring on granitic rock outcrops inside a vegetation mosaic of seasonal forests and savannas. Thus, it was possible to expand our knowledge of this species, increasing its occurrence and distributional data, as well as to provide pictures of the plants in their habitat and propose an updated conservation status.},

This work started in 2010, with the publication of the Plants and Fungi Catalogue, and has been updated since by more than 430 specialists working online. Brazil is home to 32,086 native Angiosperms and 23 native Gymnosperms, showing an increase of 3% in its species richness in relation to 2010. The Amazon Rainforest is the richest Brazilian biome for Gymnosperms, while the Atlantic Rainforest is the richest one for Angiosperms. There was a considerable increment in the number of species and endemism rates for biomes, except for the Amazon that showed a decrease of 2.5% of recorded endemics. However, well over half of Brazillian seed plant species (57.4%) is endemic to this territory. The proportion of life-forms varies among different biomes: trees are more expressive in the Amazon and Atlantic Rainforest biomes while herbs predominate in the Pampa, and lianas are more expressive in the Amazon, Atlantic Rainforest, and Pantanal. This compilation serves not only to quantify Brazilian biodiversity, but also to highlight areas where there information is lacking and to provide a framework for the challenge faced in conserving Brazil's unique and diverse flora.},

To achieve this overarching goal, the GSPC has established a series of targets, one of which is to ensure that plant diversity is well understood, so that it can be effectively conserved and used in a sustainable manner. Brazil hosts more than 46,000 species of plants, algae and fungi, representing one of the most biodiverse countries on Earth, and playing a key role in the GSPC. To meet the GSPC goals of Target 1 and facilitate access to plant diversity, Brazil committed to preparing the List of Species of the Brazilian Flora (2008-2015) and the Brazilian Flora 2020 (2016-present). Managing all the information associated with such great biodiversity has proven to be an extremely challenging task. Here, we synthesize the history of these projects, focusing on the multidisciplinary and collaborative approach adopted to develop and manage the inclusion of all the knowledge generated though digital information systems. We further describe the methods used, challenges faced, and strategies adopted, as well as summarize advances to date and prospects for completing the Brazilian flora in 2020.},

The species richness of each area was compared to that of the other two, and together to other areas of Atlantic coastal forest in Bahia and southeastern Brazil. For all three areas, a total of 1129 species in 467 genera and 124 families were found. Trees represented 46.9% of the species, followed by herbs (20.1%), epiphytes (19.5%), and vines and lianas (13.5%). The families Araceae, Asteraceae, Bromeliaceae, Fabaceae, Lauraceae, Melastomataceae, Myrtaceae, Orchidaceae, Piperaceae, Poaceae, Rubiaceae, and Solanaceae showed the highest species richness for the three areas together. The genus Psychotria (Rubiaceae) had the highest number of species for all three areas (21 spp.), followed by Miconia (20 spp.), Solanum (20 spp.), Piper (19 spp.), Ocotea (16 spp.), Leandra (16 spp.), Peperomia (15 spp.), and Myrcia (14 spp.).

O segundo capítulo trata da descrição de uma nova espécie (Paullinia unifoliolata) encontrada neste inventário. O terceiro capítulo apresenta o resultado do levantamento florístico. Foram encontradas 21 espécies em seis gêneros. Paullinia apresentou a maior riqueza de espécies (7 spp.), seguido de Cupania (5 spp.), Allophylus (4 spp.), Matayba e Serjania (2 spp. cada) e Talisia (1 sp.). Allophylus leucoclados ̧ Cupania furfuracea, Matayba intermedia e Paullinia micrantha representam novos registros para a região Nordeste. Paullinia unifoliolata, espécie recém-descrita a partir deste estudo, é conhecida de uma região entre Arataca e Una. Apenas um espécime não foi determinado especificamente, por não se enquadrar em nenhuma das espécies descritas do gênero (Cupania sp. 1). Todas as espécies de Cupania e cinco de Paullinia são endêmicas do domínio Atlântico. As áreas amostradas neste estudo apresentaram a maior diversidade de espécies de Sapindaceae para o domínio Atlântico, em comparação com outros estudos no mesmo domínio. São apresentadas chave de identificação das espécies, descrições, e informações sobre floração, frutificação, distribuição geográfica e hábitat.},

  abstract = {Volatile terpenoid resins represent a diverse group of plant defense chemicals involved in defense against her- bivory, abiotic stress, and communication. However, their composition in tropical forests remains poorly characterized. As a part of tree identification, the ‘smell’ of damaged trunks is widely used, but is highly sub- jective. Here, we analyzed trunk volatile monoterpene emissions from 15 species of the genus Protium in the central Amazon. By normalizing the abundances of 28 monoterpenes, 9 monoterpene ‘fingerprint’ patterns emerged, characterized by a distinct dominant monoterpene. While 4 of the ‘fingerprint’ patterns were composed of multiple species, 5 were composed of a single species. Moreover, among individuals of the same species, 6 species had a single ‘fingerprint’ pattern, while 9 species had two or more ‘fingerprint’ patterns among in- dividuals. A comparison of ‘fingerprints’ between 2015 and 2017 from 15 individuals generally showed excellent agreement, demonstrating a strong dependence on species identity, but not time of collection. The results are consistent with a previous study that found multiple divergent copies of monoterpene synthase enzymes in Protium. We conclude that the monoterpene ‘fingerprint’ database has important implications for constraining Protium species identification and phylogenetic relationships and enhancing understanding of physiological and ecological functions of resins and their potential commercial applications.},

  abstract = {Ecotone has been defined as “a multi-dimensional environmentally stochastic interaction zone between ecological systems with characteristics defined in space and time, and by the strength of the interaction” (Hufkens et al. 2009). This is a known concept to define transitional zones between two or more ecological communities, ecosystems or biotic regions. Ecotone forests, dispersed in northern Brazilian Amazonia, are natural formations which have been largely affected by anthropogenic impacts, such as deforestation and fire. Maracá Ecological Station, State of Roraima, Brazil, is a protected area with extensive representations of ecotone forests in this region of the Amazonia. Forest inventories and floristic surveys are important as they extend our knowledge (1) of forest structure and tree species composition and (2) of tree and palm species ecology in this region of the Amazonia. Both improve our ability to predict changes in plant diversity, considering the future scenarios of climate change in comparison with previous surveys performed in Maracá.
We present a forest inventory carried out in 129 plots (10 m x 50 m; 6.45 ha in total) dispersed in a grid (5 km x 5 km) located in a forest zone ecotone in the eastern part of Maracá Ecological Station. All stems (tree + palm) with diameter at breast height ≥ 10 cm were recorded, identified and measured. A total of 3040 stems were recorded (tree = 2815; palm = 225), corresponding to 42 botanic families and 140 identified species. Seven families and 20 genera contained unidentified taxa (12.2%). Sapotaceae (735 stems; 10 species), Leguminosae (409; 24) and Rubiaceae (289; 12) were the most abundant families. Peltogyne gracilipes Ducke (Leguminosae), Pradosia surinamensis (Eyma) T.D.Penn. (Sapotaceae) and Ecclinusa guianensis Eyma (Sapotaceae) were the species with the highest importance value index (~ 25%). The dominance (m2 ha-1) of these species corresponds to > 36% of the total value observed in the forest inventory. Our dataset provides complementary floristic and structure information on tree and palm in Maracá, improving our knowledge of this Amazonian ecotone forest.},

  abstract = {The forests of Amazonia are among the most biodiverse plant communities on Earth. Given the immediate threats posed by climate and land-use change, an improved understanding of how this extraordinary biodiversity is spatially organized is urgently required to develop effective conservation strategies. Most Amazonian tree species are extremely rare but a few are common across the region. Indeed, just 227 ‘hyperdominant’species account for >50{\%} of all individuals >10 cm diameter at 1.3 m in height. Yet, the degree to which the phenomenon of hyperdominance is sensitive to tree size, the extent to which the composition of dominant species changes with size class and how evolutionary history constrains tree hyperdominance, all remain unknown. Here, we use a large floristic dataset to show that, while hyperdominance is a universal phenomenon across forest strata, different species dominate the forest understory, midstory and canopy. We further find that, although species belonging to a range of phylogenetically dispersed lineages have become hyperdominant in small size classes, hyperdominants in large size classes are restricted to a few lineages. Our results demonstrate that it is essential to consider all forest strata to understand regional patterns of dominance and composition in Amazonia. More generally, through the lens of 654 hyperdominant species, we outline a tractable pathway for understanding the functioning of half of Amazonian forests across vertical strata and geographical locations.},

  abstract = {The harvesting of açaí berries (palm fruits from the genus Euterpe) in Amazonia has increased over the last 20 years due to a high local and global market demand and triggered by their widely acclaimed health benefits as a ‘superfood’. Although such increase represents a financial boom for local communities, unregulated extraction in Amazonia risks negative environmental effects including biodiversity loss through açai intensification and deforestation. Alternatively, the introduction of certified sustainable agroforestry production programs of açaíhas been strategically applied to reduce the exploitation of Amazonian forests. Local açaíproducers are required to follow principles of defined sustainable management practices, environmental guidelines, and social behaviors, paying specific attention to fair trade and human rights. In this study we investigate whether sustainable agroforestry and certification effectively promotes biodiversity conservation in Amazonia. To address this question, we conducted a forestry inventory in two hectares of long-term certified açai harvesting areas to gain further knowledge on the plant diversity and forest structure in açaí managed forests and to understand the contribution of certification towards sustainable forest management. On average, we found that certified managed forests harbor 50{\%} more tree species than non-certified açaí groves. Trees in certified areas also have significantly higher mean basal area, meaning larger and hence older individuals are more likely to be protected. Certified harvesting sites also harbor dense populations of threatened species as classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (e.g. Virola surinamensis, classified as ‘endangered’). Besides increasing the knowledge of plant diversity in açaí managed areas, we present baseline information for monitoring the impact of harvesting activities in natural ecosystems in Amazonia.},

Many ecotone forests in Northern Amazonia are intriguingly populated by tree assemblages characterized by distinct abundances of a single species, Peltogyne gracilipes (Leguminosae). It is unclear whether this pattern solely reflects environmental filters or also antagonistic interactions among species with similar habitat requirements. The aim of this study was to determine the response of species richness and composition to environmental filters, and analyze the role of P. gracilipes in structuring tree communities in ecotone forest areas of the Northern Brazilian Amazonia. We sampled 129 permanent plots along a hydro-edaphic gradient. All arboreal individuals with stem diameter ≥10 cm were measured and identified. Multiple regressions were performed to test the effects of environmental filters, and abundance of P. gracilipes on the tree species richness and composition. Species richness and composition responded to the same filters which, in turn, affected species composition directly and indirectly, through the abundance of P. gracilipes. Our results indicate that both abiotic filters and biotic interactions shape the studied tree communities. P. gracilipes can be considered an indicator species of hydro-edaphic conditions, but also is itself a driver of tree community structure.},

Este trabalho apresenta o resultado de uma investigação integrativa utilizando dados moleculares, espectrais e morfológicos com o objetivo de reconstruir a história filogeográfica do CPA utilizando diferentes técnicas de análise que permitam uma melhor delimitação das espécies deste complexo e a elucidação dos processos históricos responsáveis por sua diversificação. Perguntas específicas visaram: (1) reconstruir a história evolutiva do complexo Aracouchini através de uma abordagem filogeográfica, buscando saber qual é a história demográfica de expansão e contrção das populações do CPA no espaço e no tempo, e como essa história está relacionada aos eventos geológicos e climáticos na América do Sul ocorridos desde a origem do grupo, estimada em 15 milhões de anos? (2) Revisar a delimitação das espécies e a taxonomia do CPA; (3) Investigar a especialização ecológica na diversificação de linhagens do CPA. Apresentamos o resultado desta análise em três capítulos. No primeiro, é apresentada a filogenia molecular do grupo e a proposta de uma árvore de espécies juntamente com testes de delimitação de espécies; também descrevemos quatro espécies novas (P. apostoloanum sp. nov., P. linguipetalum sp. nov., P. makunaimae sp. nov., e P. vicentinii sp. nov.), resultantes dos testes anteriormente citados. No segundo capítulo, é abordada a biogeografia do complexo, inferindo uma árvore filogenética datada e respondendo perguntas relacionadas aos objetivos 2 e 3. No terceiro capítulo, descrevemos uma espécie nova de Protium, P. santamariae, endêmica da Costa Rica e que mantem maiores afinidades com espécies do complexo Protium heptaphyllum (Aubl.) Marchand, pois até então se pensava que havia uma relação mais próxima dessas populações costa-riquenhas com o CPA, hipótese falseada com os resultados do capítulo 1. Por fim, apresentamos uma síntese dos resultados no capítulo de conclusão.},

  abstract = {The Protium aracouchini (Aubl.) Marchand species complex (PASC) encompasses eight species that occur in the Amazon Basin, on the Guiana Shield, on the Andes, in the Cerrado, and in the Atlantic Forest. This work presents the results of an integrative investigation using molecular, spectral, and morphological data in order to reconstruct the phylogeographical history of the PASC by using different analyses that allow a better delimitation of all species that belong to this complex, and to the elucidation of the historical processes directing their diversification. Specific questions aimed to: (1) reconstruct the evolutionary history of the PASC through a phylogeographical approach, investigating what is the demographic history of expansion and contraction of the populations of the complex through space and time, and its relationship to the geological and climatic events in South America over the past 15 million years; (2) revise the species delimitation and the taxonomy of the PASC; (3) investigate the importance of ecological specialization in the diversification of the lineages of the complex. We present the results of our analyses in three chapters. In the first chapter, we present the molecular phylogeny of the group and we propose a hypothesis of phylogenetic relationships within the complex alongside species delimitation tests; we also describe four new species (P. apostoloanum sp. nov., P. linguipetalum sp. nov., P. makunaimae sp. nov., and P. vicentinii sp. nov.), that arose after the latter analyses. In the second chapter, we focus on the biogeographical history of the complex, through the inference of a dated phylogeny and answer questions related to specific objectives 2 and 3. In the third chapter, we describe a new species of Protium, P. santamariae, endemic to Costa Rica and sharing greater affinity with species of the Protium heptaphyllum (Aubl.) Marchand species complex, because until this study it was thought that this new species held a closer morphological and phylogenetic relationship to the PASC, a hypothesis that was falsified with the results of chapter 1. Finally, we present a synthesis of our results with the conclusion chapter.},

  abstract = {This review of Neotropical Burseraceae emphasizes developments since the last major review of the family in 2011. The Burseraceae comprise a Laurasian group (represented by Eocene fossils in the Northern Hemisphere) that originally dispersed through Central America into Amazonia. During cooling and drying events in the Oligocene, the frost-intolerant northern American progenitors were likely driven extinct; subsequently, the family experienced several vicariant events and later several long-distance dispersals across the Southern Hemisphere. From Amazonia, the family re-colonized Central America and the Caribbean. The most rapid diversifications in the Americas for the Burseraceae occurred during the Miocene in Protium and Bursera, much of it through geological events, dispersal, and habitat specialization. A number of taxonomic advances were made in Neotropical Burseraceae since 2011; these included 59 published new species overall, re-drawn generic limits in tribe Protieae, new genus records for Burseraceae in Central America and the Cerrado of Brazil, new taxa that more than doubled the number of Neotropical Dacryodes, and a recently recognized center of diversity for Protium in the Andes. Revised generic descriptions and a new key to the New World genera of Burseraceae are provided. Special attention is given to the implications of leaf architecture for characterization of clades. Monoecy (rare) and parthenocarpy (possibly frequent) are discussed, and the close relationship of dioecious trees and small bee pollination is highlighted. Most Burseraceae are dispersed by birds or arboreal mammals that carry pyrenes relatively short distances away from the mother tree; however, other modes are found in the family, including wind dispersal (rare in New World Burseraceae), clumped dispersal of pyrenes by ants and lizards, and oilbirds that can disperse Dacryodes fruits more than 30 km; some dispersers that ingest pyrenes also aid in germination. The diversity and abundance of Burseraceae in a number of regions and habitats (but especially in moist forests of Amazonia and dry forests of Mexico) are striking. This, plus the fact that the taxonomy and phylogeny of New World Burseraceae are relatively well-resolved, spotlights the Burseraceae as an important model organism for researching mechanisms of diversification, species limits, cryptic species, and “hyperdominance” in tropical forests. High chemical diversity and differences in biological activity make sense in the context of diversification and coex- istence. Studies of chemical defenses support the idea of a “growth defense trade-off” and suggest that selection by different natural enemies could be implicated in the speciation process; they also show that closely related species often display high chemical divergence, and plants with the most chemical defenses have a lower number and diversity of insect herbivores. The range of physical and chemical properties of Burseraceae resin is reflected in their cultural uses, which are diverse while showing strong ethnobotanical convergence.},

  abstract = {Wood density (WD) is an important functional trait of tree species. Understanding spatial WD variability as a function of environmental determinants improves our ability to estimate carbon stocks in the woody biomass of tropical forests. However, the role of each environmental variable affecting the intra- and interspecific variability of WD is not entirely clear for most forest ecosystems. In Amazonia there are recurrent uncertainties in estimates of regional woody biomass. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of environmental conditions on the intra- and interspecific variability of WD for tree assemblages in forests of the northern Brazilian Amazon. A single sample was extracted from each of 680 individuals (108 species, 82 genera, 38 families; stem diameter ≥10 cm) dispersed among 129 plots distributed along a hydro-edaphic gradient. General community-averaged WD (0.703 ± 0.133 g cm-3; range: 0.203 to 1.102 g cm-3) was high in relation to other Amazonian areas because 62% of the species and 69% of the sampled individuals had high WD values (>0.650 g cm-3). Altitude (a proxy for drainage), clay and soil micronutrient content explained 23% of the spatial variation in WD. Partitioning WD variation into species-substitution (turnover) and intraspecific-variation components slightly increased the explanatory power to 26%. The analysis of interspecific variability showed that forests occurring in seasonally flooded areas are characterized by tree assemblages with species tolerant to P-poor soils, where mean WD (0.742 g cm-3) is about 4% higher than the mean (0.713 g cm-3) for tree assemblages on unflooded uplands where soils have less limitations from nutrient poverty. Our results represent an improvement in the estimates of biomass because they promote adjustments (1.4%-16.3%) to the previous estimates of woody biomass in the northern Brazilian Amazon forests considering different environmental conditions.},

Tumultivenia and Uniostium, two new genera of Anacardiaceae-Spondioideae, are described and illustrated, as is one new species, Cyrtocarpa caribaea. Both new genera are strongly supported as distinct in a published phylogeny.  Uniostium velutinifolium was originally published in Bursera and subsequently combined in both Tapirira and Cyrtocarpa, while Tumultivenia caatingae was originally published in Cyrtocarpa. The number of locules and number and position of opercula in the pyrene provide the salient characters distinguishing these genera. The new species is a distinctive member of Cyrtocarpa sensu stricto but requires more collections (including fowering material) as well as material for molecular studies},

  abstract = {Abstract For more than three decades, major efforts in sampling and analyzing tree diversity in South America have focused almost exclusively on trees with stems of at least 10 and 2.5 cm diameter, showing highest species diversity in the wetter western and northern Amazon forests. By contrast, little attention has been paid to patterns and drivers of diversity in the largest canopy and emergent trees, which is surprising given these have dominant ecological functions. Here, we use a machine learning approach to quantify the importance of environmental factors and apply it to generate spatial predictions of the species diversity of all trees (dbh ≥ 10 cm) and for very large trees (dbh ≥ 70 cm) using data from 243 forest plots (108,450 trees and 2832 species) distributed across different forest types and biogeographic regions of the Brazilian Amazon. The diversity of large trees and of all trees was significantly associated with three environmental factors, but in contrasting ways across regions and forest types. Environmental variables associated with disturbances, for example, the lightning flash rate and wind speed, as well as the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation, tend to govern the diversity of large trees. Upland rainforests in the Guiana Shield and Roraima regions had a high diversity of large trees. By contrast, variables associated with resources tend to govern tree diversity in general. Places such as the province of Imeri and the northern portion of the province of Madeira stand out for their high diversity of species in general. Climatic and topographic stability and functional adaptation mechanisms promote ideal conditions for species diversity. Finally, we mapped general patterns of tree species diversity in the Brazilian Amazon, which differ substantially depending on size class.},

Biodiversity loss is one of the main challenges of our time,1,2 and attempts to address it require a clear understanding of how ecological communities respond to environmental change across time and space.3,4 While the increasing availability of global databases on ecological communities has advanced our knowledge of biodiversity sensitivity to environmental changes,5,6,7 vast areas of the tropics remain understudied.8,9,10,11 In the American tropics, Amazonia stands out as the world's most diverse rainforest and the primary source of Neotropical biodiversity,12 but it remains among the least known forests in America and is often underrepresented in biodiversity databases.13,14,15 To worsen this situation, human-induced modifications16,17 may eliminate pieces of the Amazon's biodiversity puzzle before we can use them to understand how ecological communities are responding. To increase generalization and applicability of biodiversity knowledge,18,19 it is thus crucial to reduce biases in ecological research, particularly in regions projected to face the most pronounced environmental changes. We integrate ecological community metadata of 7,694 sampling sites for multiple organism groups in a machine learning model framework to map the research probability across the Brazilian Amazonia, while identifying the region's vulnerability to environmental change. 15%–18% of the most neglected areas in ecological research are expected to experience severe climate or land use changes by 2050. This means that unless we take immediate action, we will not be able to establish their current status, much less monitor how it is changing and what is being lost.},
